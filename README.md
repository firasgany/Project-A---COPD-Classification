# Project-A---COPD-Classification
The stethoscope is widely used for listening to heart sounds (cardiology), lung sounds (chest medicine), and digestive, bowel sounds, etc. An obvious development from this is to seek to automate the process by which a physician listens to and interprets the sounds. 
In parallel with signal processing development, medical usage of diagnostic instrumentation is changing, The project described in this paper we used recording of BAT-CALL's electronic stethoscope that can that can analyze acoustic data including low frequencies (infra sound) - that has not been accessible to the medical word until now.
The project's goal is to create a reliable classifier for patient diagnosing of a lung disease called COPD based on recording of his lung sounds using electronic stethoscope.
In the project we examined several options for classifying the disease, we compared between them and presented the advantages and disadvantages of using each one.
